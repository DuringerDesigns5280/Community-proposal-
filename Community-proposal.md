# Project proposal: Community 

## Project Description

Community is a social platform to connect the LGBTQ community. 
Connecting people who are just starting their journey of coming out or transitioning with mentor who have years of experience in doing the same.
In the U.S Suicide is the leading cause of death among american youth nationally. Gay and lesbian addults are 2-6 times more likely to commit suicide vs their straight counterparts. 
Roughly 73% of lgbt youth state they are more honest about themselves online vs in the real world. 42% lgbt youth also state that their 
communites that they live in are not accepting of them.

Community- building a stonger lgt community!   



## Problem statement
It can be such a lonely and difficult time making this huge leap towards true self love. 
Having the resource to speak to someone who has experience in the same situation is priceless.

## How will your project solve this problem?

Community will solve a huge disconnect in the LGBTQ community by connecting people struggling with their sexuality/gender with someone 
who has been through it and has experience coming out and/or transitioning. This will also help empower the mentors in their day to day lives. 


## Map the user experience
1) As a user I would like to cerate and log in with my account. 
2) As a user I would personlize 'My Profile' by adding Name, Sexual Orientation, and a description. 
3) As a user I would like to be able to view Mentor profiles. 
4) As a user I would like to access national resources for the LGBTQ community on one page. 
5) As a user I would like to live chat with my mentors.
